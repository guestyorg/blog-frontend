- ([#8](https://github.com/guestyorg/testify/pull/8))(@Jony-y)

  - Added support for testing jss classes, similar to foundation

  ### **Breaking change**

  - Split `testify` to `react` and `redux` to allow better treeshaking.
  - Added imports for all existing api's:

  ```
  {
    componentBaseTest,
    setup,
    jssSetup,
    getClasses,
    mockCustomHook,
    mockHook,
    mount,
    renderHook,
    shallow,
  } from '@guestyci/testify/react'
  ```

  and

  ```
  { actionSetup, containerSetup, useDispatchMock, useSelectorStub } from '@guestyci/testify/redux'
  ```

  Utils are under:

  ```
  import { mount, mockFn, shallow, clearMocks, clearAllMocks, asyncFlush, createContainer } from '@guestyci/testify/utils';

  ```

  - `jssSetup` requires `react-jss` as a dependency
